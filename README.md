This is a script I use to convert files with CRLF (Windows) to LF (Unix).

It works in place from the command line:

``fixascii <name-of-file>``

As the name inplies, it works with ASCII text. I'm not really sure if it also works with UTF-8 or UTF-16 but I have been using it for awhile and have never had any problems. I didn't really pay attention to the encoding. Your mileage may vary.
